# LLM Operations

LLM Operation System is a comprehensive platform designed for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for various natural language processing tasks. This README provides an overview of the key components and functionalities of the system.

## Features

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**: Utilize Google's open-source dataset of Stack Overflow Q&A data. Preprocess the data using BigQuery to handle large datasets efficiently.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the Palm 2.0 model with the preprocessed Stack Overflow data. This step enhances the model's ability to understand and generate contextually relevant responses to user queries.

3. **Automated Workflow**: Implement automated workflows using the Kubeflow library. Kubeflow facilitates the orchestration and management of machine learning pipelines, allowing for seamless integration of various stages, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

4. **Model Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy the fine-tuned model to an endpoint for real-time inference. Implement monitoring mechanisms to ensure responsible AI practices, such as tracking model performance metrics, identifying biases, and addressing any ethical considerations.

## Usage

### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

1. Obtain the Stack Overflow Q&A dataset from Google's open-source repository.
2. Preprocess the dataset using BigQuery to extract relevant features, handle missing values, and scale to accommodate large volumes of data.

### Model Fine-Tuning

1. Fine-tune the Palm 2.0 model using the preprocessed Stack Overflow dataset.
2. Define the fine-tuning parameters, including batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs, to optimize model performance.

### Automated Workflow

1. Set up Kubeflow environment to orchestrate the machine learning workflow.
2. Define pipeline components for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
3. Configure triggers and dependencies to automate the execution of each pipeline stage.

### Model Deployment and Monitoring

1. Deploy the fine-tuned model to an endpoint accessible to end-users.
2. Implement monitoring tools to track model performance and user interactions.
3. Monitor key metrics such as inference latency, accuracy, and fairness to ensure responsible AI practices.

## Installation

1. Clone the LLM Operation System repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
3. Set up Google Cloud Platform credentials for accessing the Stack Overflow dataset and deploying the model.
